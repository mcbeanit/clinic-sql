# SQL Scripts for a data conversion project

## Repository Name: clinic-sql

## Description:

These scripts were developed to move data from an application written in MSAccess to the new Application in SQL Server 2008R2.  There are also various scripts that were used to model some of the queries in the new system.

These are only here for historical reasons, and educational purposes, to show various concepts in SQL.
